ChatGPT
You said:
How could I briefly describe my backend experience given that I've built a DB using postgresql, and managed the database using nodejs for a crud health application to manage patients 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clean, concise way to phrase that on your résumé, LinkedIn, or portfolio:

“Developed and managed the backend for a healthcare application, designing and implementing a PostgreSQL database and building RESTful CRUD APIs with Node.js to manage patient records.”

This phrasing:

Highlights what you built (backend for a healthcare app).

Names the key tech stack (PostgreSQL + Node.js).

States the functionality (CRUD for patient data).

Uses strong action verbs (“developed,” “managed,” “implemented”).

Would you like me to give you a few shorter headline-style versions too (like for a LinkedIn headline or bullet points)?

You said:
Now the same for front end, this time using react + typescript, react router for navigation, css modules for styling and a bunch of reusable react components 
ChatGPT said:
Here’s a clean, concise version for your frontend experience:

“Built the frontend of a healthcare application using React and TypeScript, implementing navigation with React Router, styling with CSS Modules, and creating a library of reusable components for a scalable UI.”

This highlights:

Framework & language (React + TypeScript)

Routing (React Router)

Styling (CSS Modules)

Architecture approach (reusable components, scalable UI)

Would you like me to craft matching bullet points so your frontend and backend descriptions look like a cohesive pair (great for a CV)?

You said:
Could you assist me writing a readme on GitHub? I want it to have an about me with 3 bullet points, my tech stack and something else, maybe what I like or what I'm looking for 
ChatGPT said:
Absolutely — let’s make you a clean, professional GitHub README template 👇

## 📊 GitHub Stats  

![Alejandro's GitHub stats](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api?username=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME&show_icons=true&theme=radical)  
![Top Langs](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/top-langs/?username=YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME&layout=compact&theme=radical)

How it works:
Replace every YOUR_GITHUB_USERNAME with your actual GitHub username.

Replace YOUR_LINKEDIN and YOUR_PORTFOLIO_URL with your actual links.

The badges and stats auto-update whenever people visit your profile.

Would you like me to also add a “Pinned Projects” section at the bottom (with visuals for your key repos)? That’s another nice touch.

You said:
Could you change to the tech stack react router and add styles components and tailwindcss
ChatGPT said:
Got it — let’s tweak your README so your frontend stack now shows:
React + TypeScript + React Router + Styled Components + TailwindCSS

Here’s the updated version 👇

You said:
No, keep css modules and delete react router 
ChatGPT said:
Perfect 👍 — here’s your cleaned-up version with:

✅ React + TypeScript + CSS Modules + Styled Components + TailwindCSS

❌ React Router removed
